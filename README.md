# Robust Group Synchronization via Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP)

## CEMP Implementation in Python3

Python3 implementation of the CEMP algorithm on the SO(3) group (rotation averaging problems). To see a more comprehensive explanation and a larger list of applications of the CEMP method in Matlab, check out the original author's [github repository](https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/CEMP).

See more details in
[Robust Group Synchronization via Cycle-Edge Message Passing](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10208-021-09532-w.pdf), Gilad Lerman and Yunpeng Shi, Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 2021.

For other possible usages of CEMP, see repo (https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/MPLS) and (https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/IRGCL).

## Dependencies
I used Python 3.9.7 for this project. The list of python packages used for this project is listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MattyChoi/CEMP_SO3_Python/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
